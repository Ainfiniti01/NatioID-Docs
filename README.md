# NatioID – Digital ID Management System

This document outlines the super admin functionalities.

**NatioID** is a modern digital identity management system featuring a responsive **React (Vite)** web interface and a companion **mobile application (APK)**.
It enables administrators and citizens to manage identification records, view applications, and interact with a unified national identity platform — all through a fast, accessible, and scalable frontend.

## 🌍 Overview

NatioID serves as a **presentation-ready prototype** for a national digital ID system.
The web app functions as both the **admin dashboard** and **citizen portal**, showcasing how digital ID infrastructure can be managed through a user-friendly interface.
It is built purely on the frontend (no backend APIs or SSR), optimized for deployment on **Vercel** as a static web application.

The **NatioID Mobile App** is a companion to the NatioID web portal — providing citizens with a portable, secure, and user-friendly interface for managing their **Digital Citizen ID** and related services.

This application is built with **React Native (Expo)** and designed to work seamlessly alongside the web version for accessibility, verification, and service interaction.

## 🧩 Setup & Development

### Web Application

#### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
From the root or `apps/web/` directory:
```bash
npm install
```
#### 2️⃣ Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:4000

#### 3️⃣ Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a static build inside `apps/web/build/client/` or `apps/web/dist/` depending on configuration.

#### 4️⃣ Preview Locally
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Mobile Application

#### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
From inside the `apps/mobile/` directory:
```bash
npm install
```
#### 2️⃣ Start Expo Dev Server
```bash
npm start
```
#### 3️⃣ Run the App
Scan the QR code from your terminal using the Expo Go app on Android/iOS.

Or use an emulator (Android Studio or iOS Simulator).

#### 📦 Building the APK
You can build a standalone Android APK for distribution or offline testing:
```bash
npx expo build:android -t apk
```
The generated file can be shared and installed directly on Android devices.
